**Building a Neural Network architecture for Automatic Segmentation of Brain Tumors from Magnetic Resonance (MR) Images**

•  Dataset obtained from the **Decathlon 10 Challenge** containing **484 4-D MR images** of dimension 4x155x240x240 were pre-processed using patches

•  **3-D U-Net model** was trained for executing the task of segmentation

•  **Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)** and **Soft Dice Loss (SDL)** achieved for the validation set were **0.5152** and **0.4742**, respectively.
